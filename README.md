# AlgoCode

AlgoCode is a program that performs various algorithms on a given dataset.

## Flow of the Program

1. Read the input dataset.
2. Preprocess the dataset (if required) to prepare it for algorithm execution.
3. Execute the desired algorithm on the dataset.
4. Analyze and interpret the results.
5. Display or output the results.

## API Routes

The AlgoCode program can also be accessed through API routes to perform algorithmic operations. Here are some example API routes:

- `GET /api/dataset`: Retrieves the current dataset.
- `POST /api/dataset`: Updates the dataset with new data.
- `GET /api/algorithm`: Retrieves the list of available algorithms.
- `POST /api/algorithm/:id`: Executes a specific algorithm on the dataset.
- `GET /api/results`: Retrieves the results of the most recent algorithm execution.

Please note that the above API routes are just examples and can be customized based on your specific requirements.

## Flow in Detail

The flow of the program can be further detailed as follows:

1. Controller: The controller layer receives requests from the API routes and handles the incoming HTTP requests. It is responsible for validating the request parameters, invoking the appropriate service methods, and returning the HTTP response.

2. Service: The service layer contains the business logic of the program. It receives requests from the controller layer, performs the necessary operations, and interacts with the repository layer to retrieve or persist data. It encapsulates the core functionality of the program.

3. Repository: The repository layer is responsible for interacting with the data storage system, such as a database or file system. It provides methods for retrieving, updating, and deleting data. The service layer communicates with the repository layer to perform data operations.

By following this flow, the AlgoCode program can effectively handle algorithmic operations on the dataset and provide the desired results.

## Example: Creating a Problem

To illustrate the flow of the program, let's consider an example of creating a problem.

1. The client sends a `POST` request to `/api/problem` with the necessary parameters, such as the problem name, description, and input data.

2. The controller layer receives the request and validates the parameters. It then invokes the corresponding service method, `createProblem`, passing the validated parameters.

3. The service layer receives the request and performs the necessary operations. It may validate the input data, generate a unique identifier for the problem, and store the problem details in the repository.

4. The repository layer interacts with the data storage system and persists the problem details, such as the problem name, description, and input data.

5. Once the problem is successfully created, the service layer returns a response to the controller layer.

6. The controller layer sends an HTTP response back to the client, indicating the success or failure of the operation.

By following this example, you can understand how the flow of the program works when creating a problem. This flow can be extended to handle other operations, such as updating a problem, retrieving a problem, or executing an algorithm on a problem.
